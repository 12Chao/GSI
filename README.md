# GSI

GPU-friendly Subgraph Isomorphism 

We target at a one-to-one mapping at a time, the query graph is small(vertices less than 100), while the data graph can be very large.
(but all can be placed in GPU's global memory)

---

####  Dataset

NOTICE: we add 1 to labels for both vertex and edge, to ensure the label is positive!

see `data/readme` and `data/*.g`

#### Others

My implementation of [GunrockSM](https://github.com/bookug/GunrockSM), [GpSM](https://github.com/bookug/GpSM), and [GPU utilities](https://github.com/bookug/gutil).

#### Installation
To compile GSI, simply run
```
make
```
To use PyBind11 to compile the GSI to Python module, check to `minimal_cpp` directory, then run
```
pip install pybind11
python setup.py build_ext -i
```
